# project-two -team Null

## Description 

A complete full stack build site completed as a group project. Our team used several front and back-end tools such as HTML and CSS in conjunction with Express.js, MySQL, RESTful routes and Passport.js to create a site for retro gamers to communicate and enjoy.
Our site allows users to create accounts and login to our site. Once logged in users can access comments and create posts as well as look at other users posts. Users will also be able to delete any of their existing posts and email a question or comment.

# project-two -team Null

## Description 

A complete full stack build site completed as a group project. Our team used several front and back-end tools such as html and css in conjunction with express.js, mysql, RESTful routes and passport.js to create a site for retro gaming. Our site allows users to create accounts and login to our site. Once logged in users can access comments and create posts as well as look at other users posts. Users will also be able to delete any of their existing posts and email a question or comment.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is very long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
